The NINJA GAIDEN 2 BLACK System Save Editor is designed to insert hex bytes at specific addresses in your SYSTEMSAVE.DAT.sav to "brute-force" game mode, difficulty, and costume unlocks.

This tool was designed ONLY for Steam users/save files. Unfortunately, previous versions were NOT compatible with GamePass.

After opening the tool, click "Load Save File". The dialog box should land automatically at your NINJA GAIDEN 2 BLACK SYSTEMSAVE folder. Select the SYSTEMSAVE.DAT.sav file and click Open.

With your SYSTEMSAVE loaded (confirmed at the top), click the checkboxes of whichever option(s) you want activated for your save file. Click "Save Changes" to push those edits to your file. This is NOT reversible.

Regarding Tag Mission weapons, the game does not allow the base Dragon Sword and True Dragon Sword to be available simultaneously, nor the Dragon's Claw/Tiger's Fang and Blade of the Archfiend/True Dragon Sword. Therefore, if you want the base Dragon Sword or the Dragon's Claw/Tiger's Fang, select the "No True Dragon Sword" or "No Blade of the Archfiend" checkboxes.
