The NINJA GAIDEN 2 BLACK System Save Editor is designed to insert hex bytes at specific addresses in your SYSTEMSAVE.DAT.sav to "brute-force" game mode, difficulty, and costume unlocks.

This tool was initially designed for Steam users/save files, but should be compatible with GamePass as well.

After opening the tool, click "Load Save File". The dialog box will land at a folder named with your Steam user ID in your local AppData directory. Double-click the folder to open it, then double-click the SYSTEMSAVE folder. Select the SYSTEMSAVE.DAT.sav file and click Open.

If GamePass, check 'GamePass User' before clicking "Load Save File".  The dialog box will land at AppData/Local/Packages. You will have to scroll through however many folders you have there to find your NINJAGAIDEN2BLACK folder before continuing.

With your SYSTEMSAVE loaded (confirmed at the top), click the checkboxes of whichever option you want activated for your save file, then click "Save Changes" to push those edits to your file. This is NOT reversible.

Regarding Tag Mission weapons, the game does not allow the base Dragon Sword and True Dragon Sword to be available simultaneously, nor the Dragon's Claw/Tiger's Fang and Blade of the Archfiend/True Dragon Sword. Therefore, if you want the base Dragon Sword or the Dragon's Claw/Tiger's Fang, select the "No True Dragon Sword" or "No Blade of the Archfiend" checkboxes.
